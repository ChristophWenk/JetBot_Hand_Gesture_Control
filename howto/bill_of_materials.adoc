# Bill of materials

This is a custom bill of materials derived from the https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot/wiki/Bill-of-Materials[original on Github].
The list has been edited to use Swiss vendors whenever possible.

The quantity adheres to the number of pieces that are needed to build the JetBot and not how many need to ordered.
As an example, 4 M3 screws are needed for the bot which are sold in packages of 100 pieces.

Be aware that depending on where you order from customs duties might be added on top of your order.

## Additional information

* The Raspberry Pi camera has been picked because the hardware guide uses this as well.
The assumption is that this will lead to fewer problems when installing the part.

* The M2 Wifi module has been picked because the hardware guide uses this as well.
The assumption is that this will lead to fewer problems when installing the part.

* The 60mm wheels have been picked because https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot/issues/17[JetBot was originally designed to use these].
They are also better available from Swiss shops.
However, it could be that the 65mm wheels perform a little bit better on uneven ground and obstacles.
In case of any issues 65mm wheels can be ordered from Adafruit.

* Zigobot is the only Swiss vendor with a fitting caster ball.
However, it cannot be recommended as the usability of the website is considerably below standards
and the checkout process of the website is dubious.

* Originally a https://www.bauhaus.ch/de/rothenberger-loetkolben-profi-66609889[soldering iron] sold by Bauhaus had been picked.
This proved to be very unhandy and broke after a short while.
There is another cheap model included in the bill of materials.
However, a higher end soldering station is highly recommended for the best results.
